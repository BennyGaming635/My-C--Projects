# Whats EmojiTranslatePacks?

These packs are for the Emoji Translate app. You can translate to and from emoji and packs can be enabled in the app. The app looks for packs in here to use.

Want to suggest a pack? Make a txt document and i'll consider adding it. Name the pack something like the other ones though.
