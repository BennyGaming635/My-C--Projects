STEPS TO MAKE YOUR OWN!

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Your emoji pack **must** not use any emojis already being used in other packs. These packs are the ones pre-installed. If your pack isn't accepted into being built into the app then if your emojis collide it won't matter. ðŸ˜„

> [!TIP]  
> Packs will be posted in the table if I'm told about and I've tested it. To make a Emoji Pack most compatible with the app please use the **Template**.
